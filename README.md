# The Coder Dojo @ Woodville Tompkins Marketing Page Template

This is a very basic marketing page template that we'll be using as the starting point for the apps at the [CoderDojo @ Woodville Tompkins](https://techsav.co/2016/11/25/the-coderdojo-at-woodville-tompkins/) as we start building out our marketing pages!

This README is intended to help you get started with the template, but isn't exhaustive.

## Setup

(these instructions will need to be updated when we try this w/ the github desktop app)

* Fork the repo in Github and add it to your organization.
* Download the repo with the Github app.
* Build your marketing page!
* Deploy it to Github Pages (again, will need more setup)

## Sections

There are already several sections in the template.  Feel free to remove those that don't apply or copy things and make more!  The page is broken up in to the following sections:

* Top Nav: This is the navbar at the top and starts with the `nav` element right inside the `body` tag.  If you add or change sections, make sure you update the nav!
* Jumbotron: This is the big splashy bit that should grab a visitor to the site and entice them to keep reading.
* Features: A bunch of thumbnails explaining what your app does and why it's awesome.
* Pricing: You shouldn't give people things for free, so the pricing table should explain what people are paying for.  If you only have one price point, you can probably leave this out and put a big price / signup button at the bottom of the Features section.
* About Us: You gotta show off your team!  Write little bios, talk about what your role in the project is and a little about your goals!
* Footer: Just links to things and the copyright notice.  All sites have them, why not yours?

## Bootstrap Links

The template uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), and a theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com). Want to change the theme?

### Changing the theme

* Go to [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com).
* Find the theme you want.
* Download the **bootstrap.min.css** file and put it in `/assets/theme` in your project's directory.
* Reload index.html in your browser and ta-da, new theme!

### Exploring what Bootstrap can do.

The template really only scratches the surface of what Bootstrap can do. Want to see more?  

* [CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) -- These are the things Bootstrap can do with just a little bit of CSS.
* [Components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) -- These require some specialize markup, but are still mostly just CSS and HTML.
* [Javascript](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) -- Now we're getting fancy.  Most of these features will require at least a little bit of javascript to get them to work, but you can do it!

## Help

* Get stuck?  Come ask us in Slack in either `#dev` or `#suace`, or ask at the club meetings on Thursdays!
